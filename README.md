# TDS Company Ceramics' Website

### Couple things:
- Yes, my dad "contracted" me to flesh out a new website for his company. Apparently the previous agency dipped on the money 8 years ago and the source code was filled with spaghetti HTML so it has gone nowhere since then. Since I knew a bit of HTML CSS and JavaScript myself back then, I figured it's the perfect use of my web development abilities.
- I dipped what I used for this in favor of React a long time ago. That goes without saying; if you like attaching DOM elements on the server-side then by all means stick with primitive technologies but I am outta here.
